      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a recent graduate from the <em>University of Washington</em> that majored in <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics" target="_blank">Informatics</a>.
        I began programming as a hobby when I was a teenager in middle school, making small console applications in C++. In high school I took my first programming classes
        and joined my school's <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST FRC</a> robotics team. By this point in my life I knew I wanted to do software
        develpoment as a career. I got accepted to the University of Washington (UW) and decided to pursue this through studying computer science, however, I was unable to get 
        into the program because of how competitive it was. After applying twice, I pursued both switching majors and transferring to another university. It was a difficult 
        time, however, I ended up getting accepted into the Informatics program and decided to pursue that degree instead of transferring. I continued to take programming 
        classes within my major and continued to improve my skills. I don't regret my decision to stay at UW and I believe my time was well spent in that program, despite that,
        I have been having a difficult time starting my career. I have received very little response from my applications, almost all of them going nowhere, and have still 
        not managed to get an interview. Several personal factors, including being socially isolated due to the pandemic and low self-confidence, have made this transition
        from school to career especially difficult for me. Unfortunately, the skills required to get a job are not the same as the skills needed to do the job (in my case).
        After revising and editing my resume many times and seeking out advice, I decided to enroll in Epicodus and am feeling hopeful about this new direction.
