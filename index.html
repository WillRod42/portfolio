      <h4>Bio</h4>
      <p>
        I'm a recent graduate from the <em>University of Washington</em> that majored in <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics" target="_blank">Informatics</a>.
        I began programming as a hobby when I was a teenager in middle school, making small console applications in C++. In high school I took my first programming classes
        and joined my school's <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST FRC</a> robotics team. By this point in my life I knew I wanted to do software
        develpoment as a career. I got accepted to the University of Washington (UW) and decided to pursue this through studying computer science, however, I was unable to get 
        into the program because of how competitive it was. After applying twice, I pursued both switching majors and transferring to another university. It was a difficult 
        time, however, I ended up getting accepted into the Informatics program and decided to pursue that degree instead of transferring. I continued to take programming 
        classes within my major and continued to improve my skills. I believe my time was well spent in that program, despite that, I have been having a difficult time starting 
        my career. Several personal factors, including being socially isolated due to the pandemic and low self-confidence, have made this transition from school to career 
        especially difficult for me. After revising and editing my resume many times and seeking out advice, I decided to enroll in Epicodus and am feeling hopeful about this 
        new direction.
